## Employee Churn Prediction


# Overview

This repository contains code for predicting employee churn using machine learning models. Three models - logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting - were implemented and compared for their effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

# Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.
- Model implementation: Logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms.
- Model evaluation: Accuracy comparison and performance metrics analysis.
