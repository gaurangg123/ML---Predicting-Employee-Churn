# Employee Churn Prediction


## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting employee churn using machine learning models. Three models - logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting - were implemented and compared for their effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.
- Model implementation: Logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms.
- Model evaluation: Accuracy comparison and performance metrics analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains employee-related features such as satisfaction level, number of projects, average monthly hours, etc. The target variable is whether the employee has churned or not.

## Results
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 75%

Random Forest Accuracy: 98%

Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 97%


Based on the evaluation, the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy among the three models tested.
